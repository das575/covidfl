Working backwards

To test, application.py should start with the Current Date list of lists and render that to index
I can use the list of list that's in covid_output.txt for the table
That way, I don't have to worry about the data pull and pandas -- I can just worry about the HTML transfer and flask working.
**********************
8/9/2020: 2 issues:
    c) Line 512 in scratch.py: region_table_calcs has the information needed for the X-day averages

8/14/2020:
    NEXT) In covid_usf.py ... this will make it easier to run that program repeatedly
        4) Pull in the program from scratch.py that will pull in the final calculations for the 7-day averages.
        5) Adjust for 7 days instead of 4 (x = 7, not x = 4)

8/18/2020:
    Next) I'm still making sure that the region_table_last portion is correct.
    As of now, the list_subtract was just subtracting the first county if there were multiple in the region
    need to test that the loop starting on line 274 is working properly.

8/19/2020: The final calculations seem to be working: REGION_LAST_CALCS and REGION_TABLE_CALCS (last 7 days)
    Next)
    Convert those data into formatted strings.
    Will the sorting be a problem? The two final tables are in different orders -- WHY?
    Have the program run in application.py
    Send the final two calculation tables to index.html
    Add some footnotes to index.html describing: (1) Date as of X, (2) Data inconsistencies.


?? Consider creating a function that finds the maximum and minimum of a column in the CSV file.

?? Add per capita information. Easy enough to get county population information

layout.html: Basic layout.html for index.html as well as other websites.
index.html: Build index.html, which will be a the table as envisioned (of latest date and 7-day average)

application.py: Run "flask run" which will run application.py. Runs the app which should run the program and render the template using layout to index.html.

application.py structure:
    definitions
    flask part of it needs to surround the main program of pulling in the new data and creating the current date/7-day average
    and then it needs to render the template

application.py needs:
    a) Table with latest date
    b) Table with 7-day average
    c) Number of rows
    d) Latest date
